            <p>
                Welcome! I'm Nia Quinn, a second-year Computer Science and Math student at Northeastern University (NU) with a 
                passion for optimization and algorithm design. During my time at Northeastern, I've had the opportunity
                to explore my interests through a variety of activities, including being a Teaching Assistant for 
                an introductory computer science course, being a software co-lead as part of AerospaceNU's Unmanned
                Aerial Vehicle (NUAV) team, leading the Club Running team as a captain, and even whipping up dumplings with
                the Cooking Club. These experiences have taught me valuable skills in leadership, project management, 
                and collaboration.
            </p>

            <p>
                After joining NUAV in January of 2023, the realm of possibility expanded vastly. With the help of experienced
                upperclassmen, I was introduced to exciting projects and dove headfirst into the software team. Our project?
                Obstacle avoidance. Using WeBots, robotics simulation software running in a Linux VM, we 
                we communicated with the simulated drone via ArduPilot commands. A camera stream from the drone was accessed
                via Sockets and was to be used as input to a Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, that once trained, would
                allow a drone to be placed in a random environment and avoid obstacles along a path. The repo for this is starred
                in the link to my GitHub on the left. This upcoming spring, we plan to develop a flight controller for a quadcopter 
                then cyclorotor drone using dRehmFlight software operating on a Teensy 4.1 arduino board.

                When I'm not in school, I love attending concerts, traveling, reading, and spending time with friends.
                The photo on the left was taken in Dingle, County Kerry, Ireland after my sister and I hiked a hill 
                overlooking the port. I'm excited to participate in the Dialogue of Civilizations program in Leuven, 
                Belgium this upcoming summer, where I'll have the opportunity to learn database design and foundational 
                data science concepts while working on a team to create a minimally viable product for the Belgian government.
                I'm looking forward to the challenge of working in a new environment and getting to know a new region of the 
                world.
            </p>

                Outside of the STEM world, I enjoy helping others and connecting with my community. Over the latter end of my high school years, 
                I was penpals with a senior citizen from a local assited living facility. Charlie, a veteran having served in the Marines who was
                born in Baltimore, and I exchanged letters back and forth. We discussed everything from holiday celebrations to stories about our
                childhoods. Because I enjoyed the experience so much, I wanted to share the experience with others and created a simple website to 
                do so. This allowed both students and activities managers at assisted living facilities to complete forms for themselves or senior 
                citizens. These profiles then were used to connect people based on shared interests and commonalities to build a sense of community!
